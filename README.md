# Introducing Montara!

Montara is your immersive content companion - a spatial app designed to help you organize, explore, and relive the immersive media you've captured from around the world. 

Use Spotlight, our built-in location management system, to group meaningful places into curated collections. Add unique contents for each location - from spatial photos and videos to interactive 3D objects and notes - so every place reflects what made it special to you.

Explore your adventures through a beautifully integrated 3D globe with dynamic markers that showcase all the places you've saved. See where you've been and revisit your favorite experiences from a truly global perspective. 

Whether you're someone who loves to capture life's precious moments, a traveler traversing the world in search of awe-inspiring views, or an educator curating immersive field trip contents for your students, Montara helps you organize, revisit and share you experiences like never before.
